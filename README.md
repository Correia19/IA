Smart Warehouse - Uni project

Introduction:
- Warehouses play a crucial role in supply chain management, and optimizing warehouse operations can significantly improve efficiency and reduce costs. One of the critical tasks in warehouse operations is item picking, where items need to be retrieved from storage locations to fulfill orders.

- The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can analyze the layout of a warehouse, the locations of items, and historical order data to calculate the most efficient paths for picking a list of items. By intelligently optimizing picking routes, the model aims to minimize travel time and increase productivity.

Features:
- Data Processing: Process the data through various different algorithms to determine which one yields the best results.
- Machine Count Optimization: When providing the layout of the warehouse, indicate the number of machines that will be collecting items to ensure an optimized path that avoids collisions.
- Visible Output: Provide a visible output to simulate the path that the machines will take, allowing users to visualize the optimized picking routes.
- Path Evaluation: Evaluate the efficiency of the best path obtained by the model, considering factors such as travel time, distance covered, and overall performance.
